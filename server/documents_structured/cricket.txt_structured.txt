Section 1:
In a dramatic T20 clash, India defeated South Africa by 61 runs, with a scintillating century from Sanju Samson setting the stage for India’s victory. Despite Samson’s incredible knock of 107 runs from just 50 balls, including seven boundaries and ten sixes, India could only muster 202/8 in their allotted 20 overs. However, strong performances with the ball ensured South Africa was never in the hunt, and they were dismissed well before the completion of their innings.

Section 2:
Samson’s knock was the highlight of the innings, with the wicketkeeper-batter dominating from the word go. His aggressive approach helped India post a competitive total, but the loss of wickets in the final overs stopped India from capitalizing further on his brilliant foundation. Abhishek Sharma (6) struggled at the start, while Tilak Varma provided steady support with 33 runs. Suryakumar Yadav added a quickfire 21 runs, but the middle order crumbled under pressure. Hardik Pandya (2), Axar Patel (7), and Rinku Singh (11) failed to make significant contributions, allowing South Africa’s bowlers to limit the damage in the latter stages.

Section 3:
Gerald Coetzee was the standout bowler for South Africa, taking three vital wickets and preventing India from finishing stronger. He was ably supported by the rest of the South African attack, who tightened the screws in the middle overs.

Section 4:
Sanju Samson scored a scintillating century as India inflicted a 61-run defeat on South Africa in the first T20I on Friday at Kingsmead in Durban. Invited to bat, Samson blazed away to 107 off 50 balls, hitting as many as 10 sixes and seven fours to help India post 202/8.

Section 5:
The spin duo of Varun Chakaravarthy (3/25) and Ravi Bishnoi (3/28) then shared six wickets between them to bowl out South Africa for 141 in 17.5 overs. Earlier, Samson became the first Indian to score back-to-back centuries in T20Is. The opener notched his second T20I hundred off just 47 balls.

Section 6:
His first had come in India's last outing against Bangladesh last month. However, South Africa clawed their way back into the game as they stemmed the flow of runs by picking wickets in the last five overs. Pacer Gerald Coetzee who claimed three wickets was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts.

Section 7:
Earlier, riding on Samson’s hundred, India put on their seventh 200-plus total in T20Is in 2024, thus equalling their own record from 2023. Samson added 66 runs in just 5.5 overs with Suryakumar Yadav (21) and another 77 with Tilak Varma (33) in 5.4 overs.

Section 8:
However, once Samson was dismissed, India could manage only 35 runs in the last five overs, which could cost them dearly in the long run. Both teams now head to St George's Park in Gqeberha for the second game on Sunday.

Section 9:
The Indian men’s cricket team registered a convincing 61-run victory over South Africa in the first of the four-match T20 2024 series played at the Kingsmead in Durban on Friday.

Section 10:
World No. 1 India, facing the sixth-ranked South African side for the first time since beating them in the T20 World Cup 2024 final in June, posted 202/8 in 20 overs. Sanju Samson’s fluent 107 off 50 balls at the top proved to be decisive.

Section 11:
Indian bowlers, led by Varun Chakravarthy (3/25) and Ravi Bishnoi (3/28), picked up regular wickets to keep the South African run chase in check and eventually seal the victory in 17.5 overs after bowling out their opponents on 141.

Section 12:
Opting to bowl first, South Africa struck early as India lost opener Abhishek Sharma (7) in the fourth over. However, Sanju Samson took advantage of the shorter square boundaries and lifted India to 56/1 at the end of the powerplay.

Section 13:
Samson’s half-century came in just 27 balls with two towering sixes off leggie Nqabayomzi Peter in the eighth over.

Section 14:
Indian T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav (21) fell in the ninth over but Tilak Varma’s knock of 33 off 18 allowed Sanju to flourish from the other end.

Section 15:
Samson, who struck 111 off 47 against Bangladesh in his last match in October, became the first Indian batter to hit consecutive T20I centuries with a single in the 15th over.

Section 16:
His whirlwind 107, featuring 10 sixes and seven boundaries, lifted India to a strong 167/3 in 15 overs.

Section 17:
However, Sanju’s departure in the 16th over saw India lose momentum as the world champions managed only 35 off the final five overs to finish at 202/8.

Section 18:
Gerald Coetzee picked up three wickets for 37 runs from his four overs and was the most successful bowler for the Proteas.

Section 19:
In reply, South Africa’s chase faltered early as Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh removed skipper Aiden Markram (8) in the opening over. Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs followed soon after as South Africa were reduced to 44/3 inside six overs.

Section 20:
The right and left-handed combination of Heinrich Klaasen (25) and David Miller (18) tried to rebuild the innings but the Indian spinners, led by Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi, kept a firm grip on the contest.

Section 21:
South Africa were 79/3 after 11 overs, with 124 needed of the remaining 54 balls. With the required rate climbing up to 14 per over, Klaasen and Miller tried to up the ante but were dismissed by Varun Chakravarthy in the 12th over.

Section 22:
South Africa slipped to 93/7 by the 13th over, with the chase out of reach.The lower batting order, led by Gerald Coetzee (23 off 11), showed some fight but the target of 203 proved too much in the end as South Africa folded on 141 in 17.5 overs.

Section 23:
The second match of the India vs South Africa T20 series 2024 will be played at St George's Park in Gqebera on Sunday. The four-match T20 series will conclude on November 15.
