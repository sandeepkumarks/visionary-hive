Section 1:
Our company values flexibility and work-life balance, which is why we allow employees to work remotely on certain days. However, employees must inform their managers in advance about their remote work days. Generally, remote work is permitted for up to two days per week. It is important to follow data security measures while working remotely to keep company information secure.

Section 2:
We encourage all employees to use secure networks and avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing company data. Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) is highly recommended to add an extra layer of security. Our IT team can help set this up if anyone needs assistance. Remember to report any data breaches or suspicious activity right away.

Section 3:
Paid time off is available to employees, with up to 20 days granted per year. This does not include public holidays, which are additional. For planned vacations, please give your manager a heads-up at least two weeks beforehand. In case of emergencies, shorter notice is understandable, but inform your team as soon as possible.

Section 4:
The work hours are generally from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday, with some flexibility. We understand that personal commitments might require adjustments, so please speak to your manager if you need different hours. Overtime will be compensated at 1.5 times the normal rate if you work beyond 40 hours in a week.

Section 5:
We are committed to health and safety in the workplace. Employees should keep in mind the safety guidelines shared during their onboarding sessions. Annual safety training is also a must for everyone. If you notice any hazards or encounter an accident, notify the facilities team immediately.

Section 6:
Employeesâ€™ conduct is expected to align with our values of respect and integrity. Harassment, discrimination, or any kind of inappropriate behavior is not tolerated. Such conduct could lead to disciplinary action.

Section 7:
Compensation and benefits are competitive and reviewed annually. Salaries may increase based on individual performance. The company provides health insurance, retirement options, and access to wellness programs. For more details on benefits, the HR department is available to answer questions.
